# Bengali Audio Speech Sentiment Classification using ML & DL Models

This repository contains the code and datasets for the research project titled "Bengali Audio Speech Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study". A comparative analysis of the effectiveness of different ML models and Deep Learning models in classifying Bengali audio speech sentiment was the primary goal of this study.

## Project Overview

Numerical features and log mel-spectrograms were extracted from the audio files and then processed and analyzed to determine the characteristics of the sentiments expressed.

### Objectives
- To demonstrate and evaluate Machine Learning models in Bengali speech sentiment classification.
- To design and implement Deep Learning models, mostly neural network architectures, for the same.
- To ensemble the used Machine Learning models and used Deep Learning models among themselves.
- To provide a comparative analysis of the ML and DL models based on their performances while testing.

## Repository Structure

- `DL Models/` - Contains the source code for Deep Learning models
- `Dataset/` - Contains Numerical features and log mel-spectrograms used as the dataset.
- `ML Models/` - Contains the source code for Machine Learning models.
- `README.md` - The file you are currently reading that provides a project overview, and other information.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arcane2202/CSE4238_Group5_Project.git
```

## Prerequisites
