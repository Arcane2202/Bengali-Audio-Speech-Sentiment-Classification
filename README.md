# Bengali Audio Speech Sentiment Classification using ML & DL Models

This repository contains the code and datasets for the research project titled "Bengali Audio Speech Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study". A comparative analysis of the effectiveness of different ML models and Deep Learning models in classifying Bengali audio speech sentiment was the primary goal of this study.

## Project Overview

Numerical features and log mel-spectrograms were extracted from the audio files and then processed and analyzed to determine the characteristics of the sentiments expressed.

### Objectives
- To demonstrate and evaluate Machine Learning models in Bengali speech sentiment classification.
- To design and implement Deep Learning models, mostly neural network architectures, for the same.
- To ensemble the used Machine Learning models and used Deep Learning models among themselves.
- To provide a comparative analysis of the ML and DL models based on their performances while testing.

## Repository Structure

- `DL Models/` - Contains the source code for Deep Learning models
- `Dataset/` - Contains Numerical features and log mel-spectrograms used as the dataset.
- `ML Models/` - Contains the source code for Machine Learning models.
- `README.md` - The file you are currently reading that provides a project overview, and other information.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arcane2202/CSE4238_Group5_Project.git
```

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
-Python 3.x
-Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, librosa, tensorflow, scikit-learn, opencv-python, noisereduce, soundfile along with other common ones.

We plan to extend this project by exploring more advanced DL architectures, incorporating larger and more diverse datasets, and improving the feature extraction techniques to enhance the models' performance.
